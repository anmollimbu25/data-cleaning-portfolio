# Data Cleaning Portfolio

This project is for practicing data cleaning with Python and Pandas.  
It uses real-world datasets (stored locally under `data/raw/`, not pushed to GitHub).  

## Structure
- `data/raw/` → raw datasets (ignored in Git)
- `data/processed/` → cleaned datasets (ignored in Git)
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- `src/` → helper functions and scripts
- `.vscode/` → editor settings
